# Structure of the file

`sefl_implment` folder included all the code I wrote. I implemented tf-idf with idf = ln((N + 1) / (M + 1)) + 1. I haven't tried other ways of tf and idf.

`tfidf_example` folder included the examples I found online. `religion_sport_tech_eg.ipynb` is from [text clustering with tf-idf in python](https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/text-clustering-with-tf-idf-in-python-c94cd26a31e7)
