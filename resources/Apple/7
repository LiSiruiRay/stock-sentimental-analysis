Strategic Summary:

Welcome to today’s Creative Deck Profile, this time taking the Blue-Eyes strategy out for a spin. Obviously the Blue-Eyes theme is centered around the OG Blue-Eyes White Dragon (BEWD), a Level 8 Normal Monster that is the game’s very own Engine of Destruction. Over the years, the Blue-Eyes strategy has featured Fusion Monsters, Synchro Monsters, they make great use of Rank 8 Xyz Monsters, but they’ve always been just a one-trick pony: crush the opponent’s board before they can react. The latest wave of support for the Blue-Eyes theme provided some new legacy support cards that expand beyond this linear beatdown gameplay, by adding additional control elements and bigger threats. Whether it is Blue-Eyes Jet Dragon which can Special Summon itself back from the GY when a card on the field is destroyed to True Light which gives the theme access to a recovered BEWD or a Blue-Eyes Spell/Trap each turn, this deck has plenty of cool toys. My personal favorite is Ultimate Fusion, a Quick-Play Spell that serves as an in-theme Polymerization that can use Fusion Materials from your GY, but rewards you for any BEWD used from the Field. The other key new support card was Vision with Eyes of Blue, a Continuous Spell that eliminates the Blue-Eyes strategy prime historical weakness of drawing too many high-leveled Dragon monsters with no way to get them out of hand.

Despite all this support and yet another Lord of D. retrain in the form of the Dictator of D., it wasn’t enough to make a relevant impact, but I believe that might change with the introduction of Ringowurm the Hundred Apple Dragon (YGOrg Translation). This Level 2 Dragon can Special Summon itself while a non-Effect monster is on the field, such as BEWD, and since it is a Tuner, it opens the Blue-Eyes theme up to Level 10 Synchro monsters for the first time. In particular, Bystial Dis Pater (YGOrg Translation) is a great option, giving you recovery for your banished Dragons. But with the simple combo of Ringowurm and a BEWD on your field, you can turn out a Dis Pater and a Herald of the Arc Light, given that Ringowurm can summon another Tuner via its Token by banishing itself from the GY. This simple two-Synchro combo gives you even more control tools to add to your Destined Rivals or even Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres. Live to tell the tale of your devotion to the Eyes of Blue!
